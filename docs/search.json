    "text": "Completed with CSU’s ESS 545: Greenhouse Gas Inventories.\n\nRenewable Energy Emissions\nWhile renewable energy is more efficient and less carbon intensive, greenhouse gas emissions are still generated from the production, transportation, and maintenance of these systems. Such contributions are important factors when considering the viability of renewable energy projects like utility-scale wind. Thus, the goal of this inventory is to compare the emissions from electricity generated with wind to more traditional sources such as coal and natural gas in the state of Iowa. Results are then analyzed to inform policymakers interested in diversifying the energy mix with a subsequent mitigation plan to minimize future climate change impacts drafted for the purpose of this assignment. It should be noted that the recommendation did not satisfy the American Carbon Registry’s 3-Prong Test of Additionality and is therefore not plausible.\n\n\nEmbodied Emissions in Wind Electricity\nIowa is a prime example of how the global shift towards renewable energy can impact local scales. Its flat topography in the middle of the Great Plains exposes this region to consistent wind patterns that increase in speed as they blow through the open landscape. This creates an opportunity for utility-scale wind turbine investment since productivity rates for electricity are very promising. The state’s energy portfolio has already expanded in this direction as legislation compels the energy industry to improve grid security while maintaining environmental integrity and economic growth. Currently, Iowa’s grid is mostly powered with coal, natural gas, and petroleum sources but the early 2000s saw a significant increase in the deployment of wind.\nEmbodied emissions arise from this renewable energy source as the manufacturing of turbine parts, distribution of the product to its field site, and ongoing maintenance for long-lasting performance generate indirect emissions. It is important to consider these impacts as most wind turbines are not constructed on site and, despite the handful of manufacturing facilities present in eastern Iowa, will need to be driven to the west side of the state via semi-truck where most wind farms are located. Thus, greenhouse gas emissions from electricity produced with wind sources should be calculated to fairly compare electricity production methods in Iowa.\nEstimates of each energy source’s contribution are based on existing literature and previous case studies with a consistent reporting unit of grams of carbon dioxide equivalents (g CO2) as emission factors. The objective of this study is to compare embodied utility-scale wind emissions to the other three electricity production sources in the state of Iowa to determine if this production alternative is the best method for reducing energy emissions, while also exploring how these systems can be effectively implemented.\n\n\nCalculating Inventory Emissions\nUsing R, I made a function to estimate annual carbon dioxide emissions (in thousand metric tonnes) from electricity production for application with data sets, if desired. This script was originally developed by me on April 2, 2025 with its last update on May 5, 2025 and is intended to be used with Iowa’s energy portfolio data published in 2024. Emissions factors are based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for Approach II with Monte Carlo simulations that are informed by the equation Emissions = Activity * Emissions Factor with additional guidance from my professor, Dr Ogle. Activity data is collected in megawatt hours (MWh) using a top-down data collection method to quantify the total amount of electricity produced per energy source each year. Approach II is outlined in the Guidelines with steps that identify specific categorical uncertainties, randomly select the starting value for iterations, estimate annual emissions, and then store results according to the project’s goals. A 95% confidence interval is assumed for each nonrenewable energy source.\nBelow is a list of function arguments:\n\ninput.filename describes the name of the comma delimited file with input activity data in columns describing emissions from electricity generated via wind, photovoltaic solar, coal, natural gas, and petroleum in the state of Iowa\nenergy.source reflects the number of electricity production methods included in the inventory; defaults to 1\nnyears represents the number of years of data; defaults to 1\niseed is the initial seed value for random draws; defaults to the system’s date\nnreps refers to the number of Monte Carlos iterations; defaults to 10,000\n\n\n\"IowaEmissions\" &lt;- function(input.filename = \"NAME\", energy.source = 1, nyears = 1, iseed = 739415, nreps = 10000) \n{ # set seed\n  set.seed(iseed)\n  \n  # load library \n  library(triangle)\n  \n  # import data \n  electricity.data &lt;- read.csv(file = input.filename, header = TRUE, sep = \",\", fill = FALSE)\n  \n  # validate input data is numeric \n  for(n in (1:nyears)) { electricity.data[ ,n+1] &lt;- as.numeric(electricity.data[ ,n+1]) } \n  \n  # check input data \n  ##

electricity production trends in the state of Iowa, a historical scenario mirrors the diversifying portfolio of energy sources between 1990 and 2023. Looking towards the future, a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario is drafted based on the existing infrastructure for electricity production utilizing mostly coal, natural gas, and wind. The first mitigation scenario (M1) examines the increasing investment in natural gas electricity production seen in Figure 1 with a 45% amplification of this energy source by 2030 and another 40% increase by 2050. A statewide initiative has already been set in motion with Iowa’s largest energy suppliers, MidAmerican Energy and Alliant Energy, committing to the construction of a natural gas power plant in Adair County (Eller 2015) so M1 is comparable to the state’s current activities. The second mitigation scenario (M2) predicts how Iowa’s energy portfolio and emissions would be impacted by a comprehensive transition to wind-based electricity production. Chinmoy and their colleagues (2019) studied the social and economic benefit of a scenario like M2, highlighting the enhanced quality of living for residents and improved reliability of wind power. Coal power plants would be eliminated from the energy portfolio with production goals reallocated to wind turbines. BAU, M1, and M2 would all project emissions through 2050 for all Iowans as the state energy goals previously identified in the study."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Completed with project partner Lexi Bell for CSU’s ESS 330: Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science.\n\nStreamflow & Urbanization\nAs infrastructure increases and urbanization becomes more frequent, natural landscapes are disrupted causing a series of negative domino effects on surrounding ecosystems. This trend is especially relevant in freshwater sources due to their sensitivity to change and pre-stressed conditions that draw a significant amount of uncertainty in future planning. To understand the extent of these impacts in Colorado, my partner and I examined how streamflow might respond to nearby infrastructure development using USGS data from two sites along the Cache la Poudre River. Our null hypothesis assumed no difference in streamflow between the two sites while our alternative hypothesis suggests a significant difference in streamflow as the river intersects with the built environment.\n\n\nLoad in Data from USGS\nTwo sites were selected for this comparative analysis: Livermore and Timnath. The prior is located northwest of Fort Collins and is referenced as the site with no nearby development while Timnath is downstream of the city. Using the dataRetrieval package, we can download historical water quality data from USGS.\n\n# install.packages(\"dataRetrieval\") if needed\nlibrary(dataRetrieval)\n\nsite_number_P1 &lt;- \"06751490\" \nparameterCd_P1 &lt;- \"00060\" \nLivermore &lt;- readNWISuv(site_number_P1, parameterCd_P1, \"2023-01-01\", \"2023-12-31\")\n\nGET: https://nwis.waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv/?site=06751490&format=waterml%2C1.1&ParameterCd=00060&startDT=2023-01-01&endDT=2023-12-31\n\nsite_number_P2 &lt;- \"06752280\" \nparameterCd_P2 &lt;- \"00060\" \nTimnath &lt;- readNWISuv(site_number_P2, parameterCd_P2, \"2023-01-01\", \"2023-12-31\")\n\nGET: https://nwis.waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv/?site=06752280&format=waterml%2C1.1&ParameterCd=00060&startDT=2023-01-01&endDT=2023-12-31\n\n\n\n\nTidy Data for Calculations\nSince USGS water quality measurements are taken every 15 to 60 minutes, it is crucial that they are summarized for the sake of comparison and calculation. Focusing on the 2023 calendar year, we selected discharge (cubic feet per second) as the is the main variable to illustrate natural periods of higher/lower flow rates. Thus, the discharge rate at each site will be averaged on monthly intervals.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.1     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n# extract month from each row within dateTime column\nMonth1 = months(Livermore$dateTime)\n\n# create new data frame with month and discharge only\ndischarge_data1 = data.frame(Month = Month1, Discharge = Livermore$X_00060_00000)\n\n# remove NAs for higher quality data [not necessary but just in case]\ndischarge_data1 &lt;- na.omit(discharge_data1)\n\n# calculate monthly averages\ndischarge_avg1 &lt;- group_by(discharge_data1, Month) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mon_discharge = mean(Discharge)) %&gt;%\n  select(Site = Month, mon_discharge)\n\n# rename 'Month' to differentiate for dataframe binding\ndischarge_avg1$Site[c(1:12)] &lt;- \"Liv\"\n\n\n# repeat the same steps for the second site\nMonth2 = months(Timnath$dateTime)\n\n# create new data frame with month and discharge only\ndischarge_data2 = data.frame(Month = Month2, Discharge = Timnath$X_00060_00000)\n\n# remove NAs for higher quality data\ndischarge_data2 &lt;- na.omit(discharge_data2)\n\n# calculate monthly averages\ndischarge_avg2 &lt;- group_by(discharge_data2, Month) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mon_discharge = mean(Discharge)) %&gt;%\n  select(Site = Month, mon_discharge)\n\n# rename 'Month' to differentiate for dataframe binding\ndischarge_avg2$Site[c(1:12)] &lt;- \"Tim\"\n\n\n\nCombine Data Frames\nFor easier calculations, the Livermore and Timnath data frames were binded together.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# merge data frames by row\nrow_avg_both &lt;- bind_rows(discharge_avg1, discharge_avg2)\n\n\n\nRun T-Test to Compare Sites\nFollowing the steps for a typical t-test, the normality and equal variance assumptions are first tested and then corrected.

Using an unpaired t-test, the p-value (0.262) is also larger than 0.05 so we again fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the two sites do not have significant variation in discharge.\n\n\nVisualization\nFor the purpose of our final report, my partner and I spent some time creating a scatterplot to visualize our findings. This required the individual sites’ data frames to be rejoined by column and labeled by month.\n\n#change labels to create scatterplot for monthly averages\nMonth1 = months(Livermore$dateTime)\ndischarge_data1 = data.frame(Month = Month1, Discharge = Livermore$X_00060_00000)\ndischarge_data1 &lt;- na.omit(discharge_data1)\ndischarge_avg1 &lt;- group_by(discharge_data1, Month) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mon_discharge = mean(Discharge))\n\nMonth2 = months(Timnath$dateTime)\ndischarge_data2 = data.frame(Month = Month2, Discharge = Timnath$X_00060_00000)\ndischarge_data2 &lt;- na.omit(discharge_data2)\ndischarge_avg2 &lt;- group_by(discharge_data2, Month) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mon_discharge = mean(Discharge))\n\n#combine dataframes by column\ncol_avg_both &lt;- merge.data.frame(discharge_avg1, discharge_avg2, by = \"Month\")\n\n#recombine dataframes by row including month\nrow2_avg_both &lt;- bind_rows(discharge_avg1, discharge_avg2)\nggplot_data &lt;- merge.data.frame(row_avg_both, row2_avg_both, by = \"mon_discharge\")\n\n\n#use ggplot to generate figure\nggplot_data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = mon_discharge)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Site)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Discharge Rates at Livermore & Timnath\") +\n  xlab(\"Month\") +\n  ylab(\"Avg Discharge (cubic ft/sec)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo conclude, our initial prediction assumed that there would be a relationship between urbanization and streamflow dynamics; however, we ended up failing to reject our null hypothesis. Thus, we did not find a significant difference between streamflow in non-developed vs developed settings and do not believe there is an obvious relationship between the two variables. Although this outcome didn’t correlate with our prediction, it did match the findings of similar case studies experimenting with urbanization and aquatic ecosystems.\nWhile we averaged discharge rates by month to minimize confounding bias, we also want to recognize the challenge that our temporal scale presented in looking at one year of data. For a more inclusive analysis, we would likely want to repeat the t-tests with other years or include them in our initial test using an analysis of variance test (ANOVA) instead."
