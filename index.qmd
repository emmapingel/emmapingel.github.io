#### Personal Statement

I'm an emerging graduate student at Colorado State University in the Department of Ecosystem Science and Sustainability. In their Professional Science Masters (PSM) program, I've developed the necessary skills to navigate the greenhouse gas policy landscape, estimate emissions for entities at all scales, and assess vulnerabilities in a rapidly changing world. With my supplemental Carbon Management certificate, I am passionate about quantifying the impacts of climate risks for place-based, equitable solutions that decarbonize the economy. This website summarizes my work in R this past semester to illustrate another skill that has been strengthened in the PSM program.
